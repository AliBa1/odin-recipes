    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <strong>burrito</strong> is one of the few amazing foods that can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. To enjoy a burrito you must first learn how to make one. First you have to find a nice <em>tortilla</em> that you like and place it as a base. Next, if you want <em>rice and beans</em> on your burrito put it on the tortilla as a base layer. After that you want to place a <em>meat</em> of your choice on top of the rice. Once you've done that you can place <em>cheese and sour cream</em> on top of the meat if you'd like. Then you pour any <em>sauce</em> you want on top and finally you will add anything like <em>corn, lettice, or peppers</em> that you want to add. </p>
    <p>To fold your burrito bring in the left and right sides unitl they meet in the middle or overlap each other. Next, you want to take the side closest to you and pull it until it is over the contents of the burrito then tuck it under the contents. After that tuck in the sides as well then roll the burrito from your side to complete the burrito.</p>
